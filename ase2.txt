Program command (45 marks)
Loop command work
-unit test and xml comments for simple loop : **which loop?? **
-commits

Variable 
size = 10
circle size
Show in your code how you have implemented this
-unit test and xml comments for define variable
-commit 

Expressions, (**explain this**)
-such as size = count * 10 can be used. 
Show this by writing a program in your language to draw concentric circles. - show in your code how you do this
-unit test and xml comments 
-commits

Your loop works with variable. i.e. can loop for a number defined by a variable. Demonstrate this. -Â show in your code how you do this.
-unit test and xml comments 
-commits

If statement 
-for one line
-for multiline 
-for both the program windows
-unit test and xml comments 
-commits

Syntax check

Methods 
- Can be define and called must be multiline command
    - Method with multiple parameter
    - Unit test for method and xml comments
